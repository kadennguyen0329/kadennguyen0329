## About me

I am a student at the University of Virginia who has always been passionate about exercising my creativity and using technological tools to come up with a variety of solutions to tackle everyday problems. I am always seeking new real-world experiences that will hone my technological skills in critical thinking, collaboration, and practical implementation of ideas. I constantly strive to apply my knowledge in meaningful ways that make a tangible impact and hope to continually evolve as a problem-solver and innovator, using my creativity and technical expertise.
