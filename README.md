Computer Science student at the University of Virginia pursuing a B.A. with a minor in Data Science, and passionate about building scalable software. Through internships at Comcast (FreeWheel) and Techsur Solutions, I've gained hands-on experience with distributed systems, collaborating on production-grade platforms that handle high-volume queries and real-time data processing. Through this, I've gained experience in practical software engineering practices such as performance testing and optimization, end-to-end testing, and documentation. Through joining development teams and leading projects, I've honed my skills in agile methodologies, from sprint planning to fostering effective team dynamics, while also contributing as a participant in fast-paced software engineering environments. My time as a Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant has exposed me to cross-functional collaboration as well. Eager to bring my blend of technical curiosity and teamwork to innovative engineering roles.
